Module 4 Challenge

NOTE: Code for this challenge is located in the PyCitySchools jupyter source file in the repo. 

For this challenge I am the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, I'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I've be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

In this aspect we will prepare a district summary, school summary, highest-preforming schools by overall passing percentage, lowest-preforming schools by overall passing percentage, math scores by grade, reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type. 

It is important to note that my written analysis is in the repo in the jupyter file PyCitySchool in the top line of code. I will additionally paste it below: 

The data has been sorted many different ways throughout the code allowing for multiple conclusion to be drawn. Based upon the district summary, we can conclude that as a district, reading scores were the highest. When drilling down to a school level, the data shows that schools with higher budgets and more students had lower testing scores overall. One could imply that it is harder to allocate resources and focus on individual students as the number of students increase in a school. Also, we can conclude that if a school has higher math scores, they also have higher reading scores. Additionally, based on spending ranges per student, we can conclude that an increase in budget per student decreases the overall percentage passing. It is important to note that schools with higher budgets have more students. Small and medium schools outpreformed larger schools on every prefomance metric.
